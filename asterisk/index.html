			<h1>The Power of Forecasting</h1>
			<h3>by Jared Leibowich</h3>
		</section>
		<section class="body">
			<p class="intro">The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the human species immensely, but one of the most anxiety-provoking parts of this ordeal is that no one knows for sure what will come next. </p>
			<p>In the summer of 2020, I became obsessed with forecasting Watching the news only made me more stressed: the experts couldn’t seem to make up their minds about what was happening, let alone how things would play out.</p>
			<p>Without a unified expert consensus to follow, I decided to throw my hat in the ring. I made an account on Good Judgment Open, a website run by Wharton professor Philip Tetlock for amateurs to test their superforecasting chops. Trying to answer the site’s COVID questions – about things like confirmed case levels by certain dates, or when the first vaccines would be approved – helped keep me sane while dealing with the constant uncertainty of pandemic life.</p>
			<p>I placed 1st out of over 7000 people in the 2021 Good Judgment forecasting competition, and I am currently ranked 1st in the 2022 competition. This is solely because I followed some simple rules that I have learned both by reading Philip Tetlock’s book, Superforecasting, and by forecasting on hundreds of questions. While I enjoyed reading Tetlock’s book and found it very useful, I want to state an important caveat to Tetlock’s assessment that a small subset of the population is much better at forecasting than everyone else: these forecasting skills are not innate; they are easily teachable. By using the rules I mention in this article when making your own predictions about future events, I hope that you can feel confident in your ability to think about and plan for what lies ahead, whether it be on a macro scale or on a smaller scale.</p>
			<p>For this article, I will make predictions about how the situation with Monkeypox will play out over the next several months. While it currently does not seem as terrifying as the COVID-19 pandemic did in early 2020, many people are fearful of this new threat we have to deal with, so I hope to give people reading this article an effective way of thinking about what comes next.</p>
			<p>Before beginning our forecast, it is important to discuss a sensitive issue with this particular Monkeypox outbreak: Currently, as of August 3rd, 2022 (when this article was primarily written), the vast majority of individuals testing positive, <a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/" target="_blank">97.5% percent</a>, are men who have had sex with other men. It is vital not to stigmatize this population while still being able to reach out to those who are currently most at risk for getting Monkeypox. Having said that, it’s now useful to come up with a question that could have actionable insights.</p>
			<p>While the number of confirmed cases by a given date are certainly useful to forecast on, I think that the number of hospitalizations caused by the current Monkeypox outbreak by a certain date is a better question to forecast on because it is a better indicator of the strain this will put on healthcare systems as well as how dire the situation could be on a personal level. For example, if 10% of the world population gets Monkeypox by the end of 2022, but it is a relatively harmless strain that causes less than 1,000 hospitalizations, that is most likely a preferable scenario to 0.5% of the world population getting a more severe strain of Monkeypox by the end of 2022 that causes 10,000,000 hospitalizations. The important exception to this is that if there are a large amount of mutations that occur as Monkeypox spreads, the scenario with a more contagious but less dangerous strain could potentially cause a more dire outcome eventually because there is a chance that the changing viral genome could lead to a more lethal strain, and the higher amount of cases gives Monkeypox a greater chance of mutating into a new variant that is much more destructive.</p>
			<p>With all of this in mind, I have decided to forecast on the following question: How many hospitalizations will there be in America by January 1st, 2023 as a result of Monkeypox? This question is a good one to forecast on for the reasons I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but it does have limitations, which I will discuss. As of right now, there are no reliable data about the amount of Monkeypox hospitalizations in America so far, although there are solid data on number of confirmed cases (see <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/mpx-trends.html" target="_blank">U.S. Monkeypox Case Trends Reported to CDC</a>). Thus, I will have to come up with a workaround to get an estimate of hospitalizations (which I will elaborate on in a later paragraph).</p>		
			<p>There are three forecasting rules I want to discuss while coming up with a prediction for how this question will resolve. I will discuss how each of them is relevant to both this particular question as well as any question one might choose to forecast on. The three rules are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do your research</li>	
				<li>Don’t get tied down</li>
				<li>Make a simple model</li>	
			</ul>
			<h2>Do Your Research</h2>
			<p>The first rule is somewhat obvious, but it’s still important to state nonetheless. There’s no point trying to make a prediction if you know nothing about the subject matter. You don’t need to become an expert, but you do need to learn enough so you are aware of the basic issues relating to the question you are forecasting on. With regards to the current Monkeypox outbreak, there is still a lot that scientists are learning about the current outbreak, but <a href="https://map.monkeypox.global.health/country" target="_blank">as of August 3rd, there have been 6,599 confirmed cases in America</a>. A month ago, there were 563 total confirmed cases in America, and there were 32 cases two months ago. So far, <a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/" target="_blank">98.8% of confirmed cases have been male, and for cases where there are data on sexual orientation, 97.5% identified as MSM (men who have sex with men)</a>. 1% of those who identified as MSM also identified as bisexual. As I mentioned earlier, there are no high-quality data yet about the number of Monkeypox hospitalizations in America, but I found an article that did contain these data for Europe. In <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/spain-and-brazil-report-monkeypox-deaths" target="_blank">the article linked</a>, it claims 8% of confirmed cases in Europe required hospitalization, so I will use this statistic when estimating US hospitalizations.</p>
			<h2>Don't Get Tied Down</h2>
			<p>The second rule is the hardest rule, in my opinion. When I say, “Don’t get tied down”, I mean that it’s important not to be tied down to any single ideology. We all come with biases about how “the world is,” but these biases will significantly hold you back when trying to make accurate forecasts. The most important lesson I have learned when forecasting is to keep an open mind. Oftentimes, the results play out very differently than I assumed they would, with issues arising that I did not foresee.</p>	  
			<p>For example, when making predictions about COVID cases numbers after vaccination, I initially assumed that vaccination or previous infection would mostly prevent getting COVID. But as the data have come out over the year since vaccines were available to the public, it has become clear that not only could people get COVID after vaccination or previous infection, they could unfortunately get COVID over and over again.</p>	
			<p>I try to remind myself to be open to changing my mind, especially as new information comes to light. Furthermore, I try not to do black-and-white thinking, instead, accepting that there will undoubtedly be nuance to every situation that I am making predictions on. I try to be open to hearing other views, even from people I don’t agree with often. I also try to consider the counterargument for every argument I make. Finally, I try not to let what I want to happen to have an effect on what I think will happen. Just to emphasize this once more, I try to do all of the above things, but I don’t always succeed! It’s hard to put one’s biases aside, but I find that doing so makes for more accurate forecasting.</p>	
			<p>I will relate these various points I mention to the Monkeypox question I’m forecasting on. After the spread of COVID-19 over the past few years, I have become much more primed to be fearful of pandemics breaking out, so this biases me towards the Monkeypox outbreak turning into a full-blown pandemic, even though there is currently not enough proof to back up my fears. Furthermore, I also don’t want Monkeypox cases to go up, so I hope this will not affect my mindset when forecasting either.</p>
			<h2>Make A Simple Model</h2>
			<p>It’s important to build a simple model for every forecast, but not to be overly tied to it. Rather, you should use this model as a way to structure your thinking about a problem.</p>
			<p>Let’s reexamine some of our research: It currently looks like growth of confirmed cases is exponential in America. That said, if transmission is primarily through the MSM community right now, this growth should eventually level out, resulting in an S-Curve of cases over time. We do not know at this point whether the disease will mutate into a more contagious form that results in easier transmission, thus breaking out of the MSM population, but if Monkeypox primarily stays within the MSM population, exponential growth would most likely not continue for much longer. Furthermore, because it is such a specific population that is dealing with the disease at the moment, it is easier for public health officials to target this population with education about preventative measures and access to the Smallpox vaccine, which seems to be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/smallpox-vaccine.html" target="_blank">at least 85% effective at preventing Monkeypox</a>.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4873305" target="_blank">The linked study</a> estimates the American MSM population at 3.9% of the adult male population. The following website says that there are currently 100,994,367 adult males in the US. This would put the MSM population in America at 3,938,780. As of right now, that figure gives us a reference for how many individuals are currently at highest risk for contagion. So, there is certainly room for exponential growth to continue, but preventative measures, such as trying to quickly vaccinate the MSM community, can greatly decrease the rate of transmission.</p>
			<p>With all that said, I estimate that there will be about 100,000 confirmed cases of Monkeypox in America by the end of 2022. This assumes that confirmed cases will not be exponential for much longer than the month of August, and they will significantly level off afterwards. Important to note, I am assuming that the current strain does not mutate into a much more contagious version. If such a mutation does occur, my prediction would be significantly bigger because it would assume exponential growth could continue for a longer period of time.</p>
			<p>Taking the data we have that 8% percent of confirmed cases in Europe have led to hospitalization, that gives us 8,000 expected Monkeypox hospitalizations in America by the end of 2022.</p>
			<p>I want to reiterate, I am making an important assumption that the current Monkeypox strain will not mutate into a significantly more contagious strain by the end of 2022. But if I cannot currently forecast this question with a high degree of confidence because of the caveat I mentioned, one might ask what the point of forecasting this question at all is. I argue that constructing a way to think about the question at hand is a major asset, and it will become much more useful as more data come out and we get a better idea of how this current Monkeypox outbreak is spreading. Furthermore, even if I am within the correct order of magnitude in my forecast, it becomes apparent that the current strain of Monkeypox will not lead to a collapse of hospital capabilities in the same way COVID-19 did for many parts of the country (to give an idea of how dangerous this current Monkeypox strain is, only ten people have died worldwide from the current outbreak as of early August, 2022. See: <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/08/non-endemic-countries-record-first-monkeypox-deaths" target="_blank">Non-endemic countries record first monkeypox deaths</a></p>
			<p>The forecast I have discussed in this article could lead to actionable insights, even if the current estimate is different from how this question resolves. It gives policymakers and public health officials an idea of how many resources should be specifically devoted to dealing with the current Monkeypox outbreak if the current strain remains stable and does not mutate into a more contagious form. There should definitely be contingency plans in place if the strain does mutate into a more contagious form, and there should be in-depth monitoring of the viral genetic sequence for confirmed cases to see if the virus is mutating rapidly, but the simple model I constructed leads me to currently think that the outbreak will not be anywhere nearly as large a public health burden as the COVID-19 virus.</p>
			<p>I hope this article has given you more confidence to make your own forecasts about current affairs. The rules I discussed will help you improve your predictions, and thus give you a valuable skill to have when planning for events that directly affect you and those around you. Below is a link to the website I make my forecasts on, and I encourage you to sign up. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
