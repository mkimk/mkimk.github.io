As nowadays screens, browsers, and mobile have been replacing static material, presentations of typography have also become more active and reactive. In this project, we will explore ways of expressing a text within time-based framework such as interactive, video, audio, installation, or performance. In this process, we will focus on how the transformation of the text can change its original meaning. </p>\n<h5>Assignment</h5>\n<p>Select a text and excerpt a sentence or a few words, and express it through one of the time-based framework described above. The text must present at least 3 different changes, and the changes should be applied through a theme as a cohesive visual direction, i.e. more than a few elements on the design. </p>\n<h5>Things to consider</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>A theme of changes: could be (but not limited to) — time, speed, rhythm, repetition, sequences, order, translation, etc. </li>\n<li>Trigger to make changes: time, space, sound, light, scale, movement, mouse events(hover, click, scroll, etc), etc. </li>\n<li>Elements to be changed: typeface, scale, color, content, location, voice, hierarchy, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Schedule</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>September 12: Bring 2–3 different design directions based on the chosen text. Each direction, present visual design sketches or storyboards that illustrates different stages of changes. You should be able to articulate why and how the changes happen related to your interpretation of the text.</li>\n<li>September19: Final crit</li>\n</ul>","id":"0582b9a9-6799-5755-bcaf-a179b628c071","frontmatter":{"title":"Type in Flux","date":"Project 1"},"fields":{"slug":"/b/t3f19/_project/project1/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
